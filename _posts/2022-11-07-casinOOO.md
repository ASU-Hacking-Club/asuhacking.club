title: CasinOOO Night!
category: news
---

ASU Hacking Club Member, through one of our spys investigating the tyrannical organization known as the [Order of the Overflow](https://oooverflow.io/) (OOO), we've uncovered the location of an underground gambling ring said to be run by them. 

Before we lost communication with the spy, they indicated that the OOO have a lottery that their members seem to win a stark majority of the time. It seems like something overflowy is happening to allow the OOO to embezzle funds.

We're not here for the money though, as for tonight only, the OOO is offering membership to those that can muster a "small sum" of coins. We could use this to infiltrate their inner sanctum and figure out what their next move might be.

Help us figure out how the OOO is abusing the lottery system to always win, and use it to get that OOO membership!

The entrance to the casinOOO can be found at: `nc ctf.asuhacking.club 26`

Happy hacking, and...
