Little time has passed since the great [Order of the Overflow](https://oooverflow.io/) has disappeared into the shadows as quick as they emerged. This disappearance has caused us to rethink the very way we hack. The hive-mind that is ASU HC has decided to go back. Hack back. Back to the 90's. It's time to hack the planet.

As our predecessors had done before us, the ASU HC will praise and closely worship **systems hacking**, addressing other topics as _nesscary_ to facilitate hack. We are currently looking for new members to follow the path OOO had inspired. Get on the discord and join in the journey to a perfectly hacked world. 

Prepare for the challenges ahead that the HC will release.
