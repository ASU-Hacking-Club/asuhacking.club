The only way forward is through hack. The only way backwards is through hack. Hack Hack Hack Hack Hack. Long ago we were known as the [pwndevils](https://pwndevils.com), but that term has since been hacked. Through this club, people learn to hack with elusive [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net) members through the long lost art of CTF. Those who rise to the top, join them. Until then, this club remains as the patsys. The knowledge brokers. The hackers.

To join the fray, get on our Discord. The invite has been embedded in your browser client. Find it.
